  <h1>Happy Birthday!</h1>
<p>I just wanted to say happy birthday and thank you, for being a meaningful friend and amazing person.
You helped me through my time at school when you were here, and I appreciate that. You made my 6th grade year one of my best.
I hope you're doing well, academically and socially. And, considering the school you're in, you'll have many amazing opportunities.
You've got a bright future ahead of you, and I believe you'll use it to its fullest. 
Again, thank you for everything. Happy Birthday and Happy Holidays!</p>

  <h2>What about a present?</h2>
<p>Open up gmail, and log in to hydropresent@gmail.com. The password is the letter spam in my most recent text to you.
(The one that starts with the letter D) If it doesn't work, just contact me.
The present is in that account's google drive. Good luck! (I hope the present goes to good use!)</p>
